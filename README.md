# Engineering Statistic (for KMUTNB-RE)

If you read this welcome to SANDBOX for Engineering Statistic (KMUTNB RE). In this section you are finish in theory lecture so now you will do data analysis by using python. In this repo I make some SANDBOX (or document) for you to prepare before lecture, but some SANDBOX will give in lecture week or after

> note: Recoomend you to download to read because some example result it's kinda broke.
